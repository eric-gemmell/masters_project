Where to find sequences
-----------------------

Inside src/Sequences are all the sequences for all 3 categories of YcaO enzymes, Thioamide, Amidine and Azoline forming YcaOs.
In each category, you will find individual folders for different YcaO enzymes who's DNA I retrieved manually:

For each YcaO you have:
   
   - __Fasta.fa__, the protein sequence
   
   - __Description.txt__, a brief decsription of what I know about the enzyme
    
   - __seqdump.fa__,     the resulting BLAST search with the 1000 closest homlogues of each sequence
