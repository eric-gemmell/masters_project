Where to find sequences
-----------------------

Inside src/Sequences are all the sequences for all 3 categories of YcaO enzymes, Thioamide, Amidine and Azoline forming YcaOs.
In each category, you will find individual folders for different YcaO enzymes who's DNA I retrieved manually:
  For each YcaO you have:
  
    - """Fasta.fa""" the protein sequence
    
    - """Description.txt""" a brief decsription of what I know about the enzyme
    
    - """seqdump.fa""" the resulting BLAST search with the 1000 closest homlogues of each sequence
