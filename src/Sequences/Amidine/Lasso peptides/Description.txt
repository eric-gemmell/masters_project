SviC gene which encodes a macrolactamidine synthesising YcaO. This kind of YcaO recognises the amino acid to which the n terminus will be linked.
This gene has an ERR binding protein at the C terminus, which by my knowledge is a domain that recognises the leader peptide. This ERR sequence might be directly linked or just coexpressed with SviC. 
Lasso peptides are cool because of their relatively rigid structure due to various disulfide bridges and the knot they form.
