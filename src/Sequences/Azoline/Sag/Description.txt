oxazole and thiazole forming YcaO eznyme called SagD, it can catalyse both.
It is clustered with SagB and SagC to convert SagA into a lytic peptide for virulence against human cells. 
Apparently these enzymes have activity against other LAPs (linear azole containing peptides) such as McbA, to produce their normal RiPPs
