YcaO used in the production of thioholgamide, taken from Jesko's paper. Though Jesko has already given me a sequence with a very high sequence identity, so this one might be redundant.
Apparently this YcaO is not expressed alongside an E1 protein, not sure if it contains one within. but it is expressed along with a TfuA protein for functionality. I think they are involved in sulfur transfer.
