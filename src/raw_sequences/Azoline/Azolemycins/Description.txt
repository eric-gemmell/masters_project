This YcaO is fused to the C region E1 ubiquitin like protein, hence is a C/D region YcaO.
It produces threonine, serine and cysteine azolines, which are then dehydrated to azoles.
This specific DNA sequence came from Streptomyces sp. FXJ1.264, which produces azolemycin. Not a very potent antimicrobial apparently
