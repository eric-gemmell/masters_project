Bottromycin azole forming YcaO, bottromycin has 2 YcaOs in its BGC but this one only forms a single thiazole. Description from Jesko:
Single heterocycle, follower peptide

Another paper (EcYcaO paper) indicates that bottromycin is a standalone YcaO

BlastP of this sequence only provides 27 sequences that are v closely related, none are more distantly related, even setting E<0.05 doesn't yield more sequences
