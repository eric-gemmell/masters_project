This Sequence is not marked as a YcaO by interpro, not only that, but the sequence is incredibly short, hence unlikely to actually be a YcaO.
It also has very poor sequence similarity to bottromycin, hence doubly unlikely to be a YcaO.
My current guess is that it is a RRE fragment of some sort, or a TfuA.

BAMD is an oxazole/thiazole forming YcaO, used to synthesise PZN, an antimicrobial against anthrax. Gene isolated from Bacillus velezensis 	

High E value (E<0.05) sequences were gathered since low E value sequences were not very numerous. These were deemed of sufficient quality since, InterPro indicated random sequences with high E value did conatin a YcaO domain
